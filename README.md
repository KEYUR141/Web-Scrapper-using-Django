# Web-Scrapper-using-Django

<div class="Intro">
  <h2>1.Introduction</h2>
  <p>
  This project is a ðŸ’» <strong>Django-powered web application</strong> built for practicing and demonstrating 
  <strong>web scraping</strong> skills. It scrapes data from two major sources â€” ðŸŽ¬ <strong>IMDb</strong> 
  for top movie listings and ðŸ“° <strong>Times of India (TOI)</strong> for the latest news articles. Using libraries 
  like <code>requests</code> and <code>BeautifulSoup</code>, the data is fetched, processed, and displayed on a 
  responsive Bootstrap-powered frontend. The project features simple navigation, live search functionality, and 
  dynamic rendering of images, titles, and external links â€” all managed through Django views and models.
